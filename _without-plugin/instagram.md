### Introduction

This script displays the first few images from the instagram homepage of a user.

{% include instagram.html username="jhvanderschee" %}

### How it works

I do not really (want to) know how this works... but it is absolutely awesome. Please use this to your advantage and keep it quiet. Once your images are showing up (which might take a few seconds and one or two refreshes) they are no longer fetched from Instagram. Do you like it? [Buy me something!](/donate/)

### Installation

Step 1. Download the file [instagram.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhvanderschee/jekyllcodex/gh-pages/_includes/instagram.html)
<br />Step 2. Save the file in the '_includes' directory of your project
<br />Step 3. Add the following line to your layout on the place where you want your instagram pictures to appear:

```
{% raw %}{% include instagram.html username="jhvanderschee" %}{% endraw %}
```
